# Channels by State Feature Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the new "Channels by State" feature for the Fiber Dashboard.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Dashboard Component Enhancement
- **File**: `app/src/features/dashboard/components/ChannelsByState.tsx`
- **Description**: Added a new card component to the dashboard that displays channels grouped by their state
- **Features**:
  - ✅ State filter buttons (Open, Commitment, Closed)
  - ✅ Real-time data fetching with 5-minute refresh interval
  - ✅ Channel cards with capacity, creation date, and state badges
  - ✅ Clickable channel cards that navigate to detail page
  - ✅ Loading states and empty state handling
  - ✅ Responsive design with proper hover effects

### 2. Channel Detail Page
- **Route**: `/channel/[channelId]`
- **File**: `app/src/app/channel/[channelId]/page.tsx`
- **Description**: Dedicated page for displaying detailed channel information
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Channel state indicator with colored badges and icons
  - ✅ Complete channel information display (ID, capacity, timestamps, chain hash)
  - ✅ Connected nodes information (Node 1 & Node 2)
  - ✅ Copy-to-clipboard functionality for IDs and hashes
  - ✅ Error handling for non-existent channels
  - ✅ Breadcrumb navigation back to dashboard
  - ✅ Loading states for all async data

### 3. Custom Hooks for Data Management
- **File**: `app/src/features/dashboard/hooks/useChannels.ts`
- **Description**: Reusable React Query hooks for channel data
- **Features**:
  - ✅ `useChannelsByState()` - Fetch channels by state with pagination
  - ✅ `useChannelInfo()` - Fetch detailed channel information
  - ✅ `useChannelState()` - Fetch channel state
  - ✅ Proper query key management for cache invalidation
  - ✅ Network context integration

### 4. Dashboard Integration
- **File**: `app/src/features/dashboard/components/Dashboard.tsx` 
- **Description**: Integrated the new ChannelsByState component into the main dashboard
- **Changes**:
  - ✅ Added import for ChannelsByState component
  - ✅ Positioned the component after NodesRankingChart
  - ✅ Maintains consistent layout with existing components

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Design
- **State Indicators**: Color-coded icons and badges for each channel state
  - 🟢 Open: Green lightning bolt with default badge
  - 🟡 Commitment: Yellow clock with secondary badge  
  - 🔴 Closed: Red X with destructive badge
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, click animations, and smooth transitions
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Navigation Flow
1. **Dashboard** → Shows channels grouped by state in the new card
2. **Click Channel** → Navigates to `/channel/[channelId]` detail page
3. **Detail Page** → Shows comprehensive channel information with back navigation

### User Experience
- **Loading States**: Skeleton components during data fetching
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages for failed requests
- **Empty States**: Clear messaging when no channels are found
- **Copy Functionality**: One-click copying of channel IDs and hashes

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### API Integration
- **New APIs Used**: All 4 new backend APIs integrated:
  - `/channel_state?channel_id=...` - Get channel state
  - `/group_channel_by_state?state=...&page=...` - Get channels by state
  - `/channel_info?channel_id=...` - Get channel details
  - `/node_info?node_id=...` - Get node details

### State Management
- **React Query**: Used for all data fetching with proper caching
- **Network Context**: Integrates with existing network switching (mainnet/testnet)
- **URL Parameters**: Channel ID passed via Next.js dynamic routes

### Type Safety
- **Full TypeScript**: All components and hooks are fully typed
- **Zod Validation**: API responses validated with existing schemas
- **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling throughout the flow

## 📁 File Structure

```
app/src/
├── features/dashboard/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Dashboard.tsx (✅ modified)
│   │   └── ChannelsByState.tsx (✅ new)

│   └── page.tsx (✅ new)
└── lib/
    ├── client.ts (✅ modified - added 4 new API methods)
    └── types.ts (✅ modified - added new types)
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Dashboard loads** → `ChannelsByState` component mounts
2. **User selects state** → Triggers new API call via `useChannelsByState()`
3. **User clicks channel** → Navigates to detail page with channel ID
4. **Detail page loads** → Fetches channel info, state, and connected nodes
5. **Real-time updates** → Components refresh every 5 minutes

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- **Pagination**: Add pagination controls for channels list
- **Search/Filter**: Add search functionality for specific channels
- **Node Detail Pages**: Create similar pages for individual nodes
- **Export Features**: Add CSV/JSON export for channel data
- **Channel Analytics**: Add charts and metrics for channel performance
